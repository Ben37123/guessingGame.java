# guessingGame.java
This was my first program that I did in my programming 3 class my senior year of high school. I learned python my sophomore year and now I am learning Java. This is a number guessing game hat lets you choose the range of a number, gives you a retina amount of guesses, tells you higher or lower, and tells you if your guess is correct. You can also play again.
